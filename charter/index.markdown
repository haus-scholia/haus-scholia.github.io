#Charter

_The noble fellowship. For exploration, knowledge, fun and friendship._

Haus Scholia is a Guild Wars 2 guild formed from a network of real-life friends and acquaintances.

This charter is published in the interest of transparency. There are only four hard rules; everything else is simply guidelines and organizational information. While organized with feudal titles for the sake of pomp, Haus Scholia is a meritocracy. Suggestions and critique are welcome and encouraged from all members.

##Heraldry

A knot of crimson and gold representing knowledge and adventure, surrounded by an ebony crown representing fellowship.

##Home World

Haus Scholia is located in the Ruins of Surmia, an EU server. To take full advantage of the benefits of the guild, you must also be on RoS. If you are not on RoS, this will require a [transfer](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World#Transferring). Since RoS has a medium population, this is only 500 gems. If you don't want to transfer, but are still in the EU region, please [guest](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World#Guesting) with us. If you are in the North American region, unfortunately you won't be able to guest, and your only option to play with us is to transfer. We are willing to assist with transfer costs if needed.

##Rules

1. Be civil. You represent both yourself and the guild.
2. Write intelligently. Roleplay as much as is possible.
3. Representation is required when participating in guild events.
4. Hateful or offensive language of any kind, in any situation, will not be tolerated.

##Guidelines

- Representation is not required for membership, but is encouraged.
- Title advancement will not be considered unless a member regularly represents the guild.
- In meetings, full sentences are greatly preferred to teh txt.
- During organized activities, Steam Voice chat is used. You are not required to talk, but are strongly encouraged to listen.

###The Bank

- Deposit only what you want to give away.
- If you need something, take it, but don't be greedy.
- Gold deposited goes to the Commander Fund.

###The Commander Fund

- A commander is needed for groups larger than a single party (squads, trains).
- Being a commander is a huge responsibility.
- Friedegund Frei wants that responsibility, and is proving herself through a number of [ordeals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Alk-dTyQnKtrdG1CVTN5Z2J4R04wWldRWHJrODV4MFE&usp=drive_web#gid=7).
- The guild will finance her goal, if she proves herself.

###Chat

- /g is for guild banter, organizing events, and managing large sorties without a commander.
- /p is for the nitty-gritty on what your party is doing.
- /d is for squad logistics.
- /s is for interacting with other players and for roleplaying.
- /m is for the whole map... remember that you're representing the guild.
- If it's not one of those things, it probably belongs in a whisper (/w).

##Activities

Official guild nights are currently Saturdays, 10pm. Log in, join Steam voice chat, and party up! You can find someone online most every other night as well, but those are all freeform.

Here is a list of the various things we might be doing (in no particular order):

<ul class="square">
<li>An emphasis on roleplaying, because it is fun!</li>
<li>Clearing the many dungeons of Tyria of their monsters, for pay of course (Gold and Tokens).</li>
<li>Client work (Guild Missions) organized by our Guild Master in Divinity's Reach, to earn our bread and butter (Influence).</li>
<li>Jump puzzles are just great. Work those legs!</li>
<li>Exploration (Map completion) is important, to unfold the vastness of Tyria and increase reknown.</li>
<li>Events deepen engagement with the vast world and help bolster our name.</li>
<li>Serving in the Battle for the Mists (WvW) is necessary to increase reknown and earn our keep.</li>
<li>Participating in organized gladiatorial matches (PvP) is important to hone combat training and personal awareness.</li>
<li>Gathering and farming are important to support our crafts and furnish the guild with high-quality equipment.</li>
<li>Assisting other players (both in-guild and out-of-guild) is critical to increase reknown and build lasting relationships.</li>
<li>Socials, balls, galas, council meetings, races, lotteries, and ad-hoc minigames are all other fun ways to socialize.</li>
</ul>

Sometimes an event will be announced in advance, sometimes we will all decide on the fly.
