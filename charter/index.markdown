#Charter

_The noble fellowship. For exploration, knowledge, fun and friendship._

Haus Scholia is a Guild Wars 2 guild formed from a network of real-life friends and acquaintances.

This charter is published in the interest of transparency. There are only four hard rules; everything else is simply guidelines and organizational information. While organized with feudal titles for the sake of pomp, Haus Scholia is a meritocracy. Suggestions and critique are welcome and encouraged from all members.

##Heraldry

##Home World

Haus Scholia is located on Ehmry Bay, a NA server. To take full advantage of the benefits of the guild, you must also be on EB. If you are not on EB, this will require a [transfer](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World#Transferring). If you don't want to transfer, but are still in the NA region, please [guest](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World#Guesting) with us. If you are in the EU region, unfortunately you won't be able to guest, and your only option to play with us is to transfer. We are willing to assist with transfer costs if needed.

##Rules

1. Be civil and polite. You represent both yourself and the guild.
2. Write intelligently. Roleplay as much as is possible.
3. Representation is required when participating in guild events.
4. Hateful or offensive language of any kind, in any situation, will not be tolerated.

##Guidelines

- Representation is not required for membership, but is encouraged.
- Title advancement will not be considered unless a member regularly represents the guild.
- In meetings, full sentences are greatly preferred to teh txt.
- During organized activities, Steam Voice chat is used. You are not required to talk, but are strongly encouraged to listen.

###Chat

- /g is for guild banter, organizing events, and managing large sorties without a commander.
- /p is for the nitty-gritty on what your party is doing.
- /d is for squad logistics.
- /s is for interacting with other players and for roleplaying.
- /m is for the whole map... remember that you're representing the guild.
- If it's not one of those things, it probably belongs in a whisper (/w).

###The Bank

- Deposit only what you want to give away.
- If you need something, take it, but don't be greedy.
- Gold will be used at the discretion of the leadership, and is not to be withdrawn by Scholars or Initiates.

##Activities

Official guild nights are currently Saturdays, 9pm ET. Log in, join Steam voice chat, and party up! You can find someone online most every other night as well, but those are all freeform.

Here is a list of the various things we might be doing (in no particular order):

<ul class="square">
<li>Clearing the many dungeons of Tyria of their monsters, for pay of course (Gold and Tokens).</li>
<li>Jump puzzles are just great. Work those legs!</li>
<li>Exploration (Map completion) is important, to unfold the vastness of Tyria and increase reknown.</li>
<li>Events deepen engagement with the vast world and help bolster our name.</li>
<li>Client work (Guild Missions) organized by our Guild Master in Divinity's Reach, to earn our bread and butter (Influence).</li>
<li>Serving in the Battle for the Mists (WvW) is necessary to increase reknown and earn our keep.</li>
<li>Participating in organized gladiatorial matches (PvP) is important to hone combat training and personal awareness.</li>
<li>Gathering and farming are important to support our crafts and furnish the guild with high-quality equipment.</li>
<li>Assisting other players (both in-guild and out-of-guild) is critical to increase reknown and build lasting relationships.</li>
<li>Socials, balls, galas, council meetings, races, lotteries, and ad-hoc minigames are all other fun ways to socialize.</li>
<li>Everything with an emphasis on roleplaying, because it is fun!</li>
</ul>

Sometimes an event will be announced in advance, sometimes we will all decide on the fly.
