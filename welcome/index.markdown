##Welcome to Haus Scholia!

Don't be intimidated by this "orientation guide." It is simply to ensure you're able to get the most out of the various guild resources we've established.

Please take a few minutes to read through both this page and our [charter](http://hausscholia.net/charter). If any of it isn't clear, or if you disagree with any of it, please join the discussion on our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/516760688392090/).

Some of us have been playing since launch, and some for only a few months. We're all quite friendly and agreeable, happy to help out regardless of level. The primary goal of this guild is to have fun together as friends, so if you're ever not having fun, let us know, and we'll try to fix that.

##Resources

First there is this website, [hausscholia.net](http://hausscholia.net). Here we have our [charter](http://hausscholia.net/charter), this [welcome guide](http://hausscholia.net/welcome), and a [blog](http://hausscholia.net/news), [gallery](http://hausscholia.net/gallery), and [profile pages](http://hausscholia.net/roster) that all members can edit. (Instructions below.)

There is a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/516760688392090/) for discussion, banter, and organization. Since we're all connected to each other somehow in the real world, we thought this would be easier than setting up forums.

We also have a [Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/hausscholia), but only use it for Voice chat.

##Website: blog, roster & gallery

To edit your roster page, or write news posts if you so desire (the gallery is still under construction):

1. Set up a GitHub account.
    1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and click "Sign up for a GitHub Account." (Green button, top right.)
    2. Put in your info, stick with the free plan, and "Create an account."
    3. There will be some sort of email verification.
    4. Once you are logged in, proceed to step 2.

2. Make sure I know your GitHub username, and wait until I tell you that you have access.
3. Head to [prose.io](http://prose.io/) and let it access your GitHub account.
4. In the sidebar, under Groups, select "haus-scholia.
5. Select the "haus-scholia.github.io" entry.
6. If you want to edit your roster page, go into "members" and select your entry.
7. If you want to write a post, go into "news" and select "new file."
8. Once you're done editing/writing, click "Changes to Save" (floppy disk icon), review what you've done, and click "Commit."

###Markdown syntax

Everything needs to be written in a syntax called Markdown, which is actually a super easy way to write formatted HTML. When writing in Markdown, most of the time you can just write. Write, write, write. But when you want to insert links and pictures, or add emphasis, breaks, and headers, then you need a tiny bit of additional syntax.

Take a look at [what I wrote in mine](https://raw.github.com/haus-scholia/haus-scholia.github.io/master/_posts/members/2013-09-23-Neranna-Taitar.markdown), and compare it to what you see on the [actual page](http://hausscholia.net/roster/Neranna-Taitar/). Feel completely free to simply use my text and replace it with yours, or to use a completely different format.

Sets of `#` make a header at the proper level. You can go between `#` and `####` for different sizes. (One is the largest, four is the smallest.)

Surrounding text with underscores, like `_text_` will make it italic. Surrounding text with asterisks, like `*text*` will make it bold.

Links look like `[text you see on the page](http://example.com)`. Images look like `![image alt text](http://example.com/example.jpg)` (It's the link syntax with an exclamation mark in front).

You should note that to have a linebreak on the page, you need to have two linebreaks when you're writing. (It's a quirk of Markdown.)

If you know HTML, guess what? You can use that too, if you prefer. Skip all the headers and stuff... only use the tags you'd use inside `<body></body>`.

###Images

There are many different image uploading/sharing services out there. Use whatever one floats your boat. It's always nice to be able to manage the files you upload, however, instead of just sending them into a void. Personally, I use CloudApp for all my file sharing. (Yes, it's geared towards Macs, but I use it on both Windows and Mac all the time with no issues.)

The thing to note when you are embedding images in Markdown (regardless of what your sharing service is) is to get an image url, and not a shortlink url. It needs to end in `.jpg` or `.png`. For me, I get these sorts of links when I upload to CloudApp [http://cl.ly/image/2k2m1Z2Q320n](http://cl.ly/image/2k2m1Z2Q320n), and then I have to click "Direct link" on the top right to get the full image link: [http://f.cl.ly/items/1f0t0b25463m3M101g0U/gw079.jpg](http://f.cl.ly/items/1f0t0b25463m3M101g0U/gw079.jpg).

##Steam Voice

To join our group voice chat room:

1. Connect a microphone to your computer
2. Open the Settings window (in Steam), switch to the Voice tab, and test your send/receive levels.
3. Open the Friends window
4. Switch to the Groups tab
5. Click the dropdown arrow next to Haus of Scholia and select "Enter group chat room"
6. In the window that opens, click the dropdown arrow and select "Start voice"

##Closing

That should be pretty much all you need to get connected and started. We're happy to answer any further questions if you need, just post in the Facebook group, in-game, or ask in Voice chat.

Again, welcome to Haus Scholia, and happy adventuring!
