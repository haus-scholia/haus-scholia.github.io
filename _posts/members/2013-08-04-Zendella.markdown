##Zendella
_Human Mesmer_

My name is Zendella and I was born to a family of nobles in Divinity's Reach. My family has always been ridiculously wealthy, and mother says our blood can be traced back to ancient Krytan kings, but she could just be telling stories. I've lived a very priveleged life; from my childhood, I can recollect a lot of fancy parties filled with a lot of snooty people. It was quite literally just social gathering after social gathering. My sister and I didn't really have a care in the world; it was great to be honest. Everything was handed to us on a silver platter. We never had to work hard for anything, but we still had our responsibilities, namely our education. When you live amongst the nobility, the more educated you are, the more high-society you are. It's just the way it is. Your level of education speaks equal in value to the most costly spirit you'd have in your cupboard.

But wealth is a double-edged sword...

On my eleventh birthday, my little sister Orianna was kidnapped, taken by bandits and held for ransome. Since that day, I've regretted not personally looking for her. My parents did all they could to try to bring her back, but they were unsuccessful.. but between you and me, I don't think they tried very hard to find her.

But enough of the grim stuff - back to me!

As a child, I was always the life of the party. I could spin a story that would captivate your interest before leaving you in stitches, or dazzle you with my impressive worldly knowledge; with my sparkling charm, I could make even the most detestable party guest feel as if he were the most welcome. It was because of these gifts (as well as my radiant beauty) that others have proclaimed how I was blessed by Lyssa when I was born. But there was another reason they said that.

You see, aside from being uncannily witty, attractive, _and_ humble, I've also always had a very remarkable gift for illusion. I can make people see things that aren't there, or make them NOT see things that really are. With my intent alone, I can force people to become forgetful, or sad, or angry, and they'll have no idea why. I was able to use this talent to cause a lot of mischief in my day, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't take pleasure in it. But it was this same talent that would later prompt me to grow into the experienced Mesmer I am today. After several years of practice and training, I had finally grown powerful enough to set out on a journey to find my long-lost baby sister. One fateful day in the village of Shaemoor was the spark that made it all possible, and after becoming personally acquainted with Captain Logan Thackeray of the Queen's Guard, I quickly gained access to all the necessary resources I'd ever require to find Orianna.

Now that I've rescued her from the gang that held her captive for almost a decade, I've got some bigger fish to fry... _much_ bigger. Now I seek Zhaitan. I yearn to bring him down. And let me tell you, it's not about the fame or the fortune, nor the glory; I'm doing it simply for the thrill. I desire to confront the most terrifying creature in all of Tyria and bathe in pleasure as I rend his sanity from his mind, not that he had any sanity to begin with. I wish to explore his deepest thoughts, to toy with his emotions, to analyze his motives. Hell, maybe I'd even like to trick him into thinking he's a beautiful ballerina! And why not? You might think I have a problem - a deathwish, perhaps. And maybe I do. But come on, you have to admit that it would be hilarious! I mean, afterall, life _is_ just a joke, is it not? And nobody likes a joke that isn't funny. I'm just trying to bring a little comedy to the situation. I'm really actually doing you a massive favor.

_You're welcome._

##Karistany
_Human Guardian_

Although I grew up in the nobility of Divinity's Reach, I never knew my birth parents. My adoptive parents were good to me; they raised me to be respectful and honest. I was always told Dwayna had blessed me, which makes sense, considering I have a gift for healing. I've always been a devoutly spiritual person.

When I became of age, I decided to join the Temple of Fanatics and become a Guardian. I took to the art right away, and my superiors were impressed with my natural attunement to the light as well as my healing ability. Although many of the monks and priests of my order can be a bit harsh, I tend to have a more open view on the world. I tackle life head-on and prefer to use my sense of Honor and Dignity in all my personal affairs.

Eventually I was reunited with my sister Kimiko, who was raised by our birth-parents in the sunny plains of Queensdale. Getting the chance to meet my mother and father was an honor and a privelege.

With my trusty shield and Dwayna by my side, it is my job to protect the innocent and to serve the Greater Good.

##Selia Jade
_Sylvari Necromancer_

My name is Selia. I awoke under the Pale Tree during the Cycle of Dusk. I can feel the dusk's essence within me; magic and mystery courses through my veins. The most important of Ventari's teachings is in my opinion "Act with wisdom, but act".

While in my slumber, I dreamt of the moon. It was from this moment that I knew the mystic realm had called to me. I would be born with the gift of magic.

Of what brand of magic, I was not yet sure. When I awoke, I found that I could speak to the dead - I had been born a Necromancer.

I took this duty willfully, and I will continue to grow until I can harness the power of death for all the good of Tyria. Whatever problems may come my way, I will face them determinedly and aggressively. My fierocity cannot be extinguished.

Somebody has to protect the land, and as a Sylvari, it is my job to do so. And even though death may come knocking on our doorstep at the worst of times, I will fearlessly stare death in the face with the mask of a skull, and remind him that he works for me, for Tyria, for all living things. The sanctity of life must be protected against the dragons, no matter the cost.
