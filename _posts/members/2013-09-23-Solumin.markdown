## Ash Clawburn
Charr Engineer -- Focus: Flamethrower/Elixir Gun, Turrets, Pistols/Shield

Like other charr, I never knew my parents; I was raised in the Iron Legion fahrar. That is where I learned and grew. My warband--my real family--and I met in the fahrar and were inseperable until they were killed in an Ascalonian attack on the Black Citadel. Only Clawspur, my sparring partner, survived. I am now forming my own warband from the charr that Clawspur and I meet in our travels.

Though I never really knew my father, I know he is a loyal soldier in the Legion. I will live up to his reputation and keep the honor of the Iron Legion and my warband.

I'm an engineer in the proud tradition of my Legion. I wear my eagle-eye goggles, my first creation, with pride. As an engineer, I rely upon kits and turrets in battle. I'm especially fond of my flamethrower and find few enemies that can stand against it. And if that doesn't work, my elixir gun will break them down! I also use turrets as backup, though they tend to break as soon as an enemy looks at them. When all else fails, I fall back on my trusty pistol and a shield.

Outside of battle, I rely on my dignity to carry me through an trouble I may face.

## Eoghan the Limber
Sylvari Thief -- Focus: Pistols/Daggers, Shortbow, Poisons

The Pale Tree woke me from the Dream during the Cycle of Dawn. Accordingly, I'm friendly and sociable, and I use my wit and charm to my advantage. If I wasn't such a good thief, I'd make an excellent diplomat! I'm something of a free spirit and let the winds guide me. To me, Ventari's most important lesson is, "Where life goes, so too, should you."

I was awakened to help defend the Pale Tree and the Sylvari. While Dreaming I saw the Green Knight. It is my duty to find and vanquish him in order to protect my people.

As a thief, my strengths lie in subtletly and disguises. I blend into a crowd to track my targets. I strike when I have a chance, relying on my strong daggers to take down the foe. Sometimes I'll add a dash poison to seal the deal. If the battle needs to be quiet and at a distance, I use my shortbow to great effect. And when all else fails, I fall back on my dual pistols to carry me through the worst trouble.
