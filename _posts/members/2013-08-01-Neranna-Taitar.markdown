##Neranna Taitar ("Nerry")
_Human Thief_

Grenth, the god of death, "blessed" me as an infant. I've lived with that curse ever since. Trouble follows me like a plague, but my lighthearted and ferocious nature allows me to shake it off. I've worked hard to make something of myself, and I've built a strong circle of good friends around me.

My people were dirt poor. I grew up in the slums of Divinity's Reach, and there I learned how fend for myself. Looking back, I honestly think it was the best education a girl could ask for.

Now I'm a professional rogue, an expert at subtlety, intrigue and charm. I can blend into the crowd, or lead it when I need to. I'm also good at finding people, places, and information that are not meant to be found. When you need a nimble expert of bow, pistol and whirling daggers, I'm the woman you should look for.

##Friedegund Frei ("Frieda")
_Norn Guardian_

We moved south when the deep cold came. I was still a child. Lornar's Pass was rich then, full of fish and rabbit. The cold has crept even further south since then. I fear if we do not make a stand, it will keep on spreading until there is nothing green left.

Growing up in the shadow of the Priory, I suppose it is only natural that I gained a love of books and a fascination with magic. I have always felt a deep connection with the Spirits of the Wild, and I am comforted to know they are always there for me. I don't really remember joining the Priory. I spent so much time there as a youth, it seemed a rather seamless process.

The losses of Owl, Eagle, Wolverine and Ox still cut me deeply, as they do all norn. I have dedicated my study, my strength, my service to do everything in my power, with all the resources of the Priory at my disposal, to ensure the four remaining Spirits continue to stand strong. In time, I hope that we will destroy Jormag, win the north back, and restore the lost Spirits to their former glory.

Until that time, I will gather friends around me and hone myself in combat against the lesser evils of Tyria. It is only united that we will defeat Jormag, and to gain the aid of others I must earn their allegiance. So I will go forth, south and east and west, to protect those in need in the ways I know. I will earn a name for myself, and I swear, when I return, Jormag will tremble to hear it.

##Akaria Rubeathin ("Kari")
_Human Necromancer_

I grew up among the nobility, and have never wanted for anything. The common people love me, and so does the queen. I value the honor of my family's name, but have always wanted to show the people that I am worth something without it. So I set myself on a course of study, to learn the best way to defeat the rising evil in the land.

I held an apprenticeship with the archmage of Queen Jenna's court, and under his tutelage I learned all there is to know about Earth Elementalism. But try as I might, I could not make the energy flow. Dejected, I sought the advice of my dear friend Neranna, who suggested I hold a vigil at the Fount of Kormir. So I did, and in the soft waters of the fountain I found the truth: the only way to combat the rising evil in the land is to make peace with death and use it itself as a weapon. Though my father frowned upon it, I sought out the Necromancers' Enclave in the Underbelly of Lion's Arch, and I have been studying with them ever since.

When I go forth to face the evil in the land, I paint my face with the symbol of a skull, to signify to the people that I am at peace with death. I carry a knife (the symbol of blood), a string of nooses (a symbol of judgement), and a staff (the symbol of a leader). I am death's messenger, cleansing the land of evil and making it safe for my dear people.

##Vakanya Dolshynya ("Anya")
_Norn Warrior_

I never knew my parents. They were murdered by servants of Jormag, and I was raised by the shamans of the Wolf. Our precious homeland is lost to us, and we are still threatened by enemies on all sides. Sometimes my sorrow and rage threaten to consume me, but the spirit of Wolf has taught me that there is both a time for violence and a time for peace.

I have chosen the path of the warrior, and I work hard to maintain my physical strength and prowess. I carry an axe and a horn, the ancient weapons of my people, and I carry a hammer to break my foes, just as they have broken my heart. I wear no helm on the battlefield, as I would rather look my foes in the eyes. That way they may see my fearless determination and quake in the face of my righteous anger. I have dedicated my life to winning back our homeland, and until I can sit at my family's hearth and set my parents' souls to rest, I will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand against me.

##Feairraelly Shaeln ("Elly")
_Norn Ranger_

My mother brought me up to respect Raven, whom I have taken as my spirit guide. My father was always tinkering with things, and as a child I would follow him around everywhere, watching him work. After my coming of age, when it came time for me to forge a path for myself, I decided to travel to Rata Sum and study with the asura. Six years later, I returned with my engineer training to find a vastly different land than the one I left. The borderlands were overrun with grawl, and the jotun had turned mean. I wanted to help, but found whenever there was a skirmish I would spend more time preparing my equipment than I would fighting.

I sought some clarity at the shrine of Raven. I remembered that Raven teaches us that there's a time for thought and a time for action. I realized that I was spending far too much time thinking than I was acting. Valuable as my engineer training is, engineering is slow, when what was needed was quick-acting people to take on the intruders. So I picked up my grandfather's bow, and with a raven on my shoulder set off to combat the icy menace.

I'm a ranger. I roam freely across the wilds, and I have a way with animals. I am good friends with the shaman of Bear, and she gave me one of her cubs to raise as my companion. I remain quiet and reserved, yet I make friends wherever I go. My enemies think twice before fighting me, for I never stand alone.

##Kinydha
_Asura Engineer_

You want to hear about me? I don't really know what to tell you. I'm just your typical scholar. I studied Dynamics and Statics in full, of course, but I specialized in Synergetics. The Eternal Alchemy is, well, eternally fascinating for me. You know... the current of energy that flows through everything? No? Ah well. Not enough time to explain. I'd show you but... I might break something here. Later, I will.

Anyway... what was I telling you? Oh, right. Well, I just graduated from Synergetics, and I'm waiting for an assignment. I probably shouldn't tell you this... promise not to gossip? I had to take my thesis class with Zojja. She was absurdly impressed by my piece... I called it the "Interspatial Locator." Junk, really, but it demonstrated a powerful notion. She's been following me around ever since, nagging me to do "great things." I wish she'd get off my back. She's such an old windbag. All I want to do is explore some other regions of Tyria and soak up some intercultural experiences.

So I ran away in the middle of the night... well, early morning, once Zojja was finally asleep. I took along my fully stocked elixir kit, and my beloved rifle. I just arrived here in Lion's Arch this evening. Do you know anyone in need of an alchemist or a sniper?

##Jet Heartstrike ("Jet")
_Charr Elementalist_

The Blood Legion is my father, my mother, my family, my home. I live for the glory of victory and the honor of blood.

They wanted me to be one of the berserkers, carrying nothing but swords into the thick of the fray. That always felt awkward doing during training, so I requested a different assignment. It took a bit of strongarming, but I secured a position in the elite squad of elementalists. Now I'm still in the thick of things, but I hang back just a little bit, supporting my warband with the powers of fire, earth, air and water.
