##Neranna Taitar ("Nerry")
_Human Thief_

My people were dirt poor, and I've struggled all my life. Grenth, the god of death, blessed me as an infant. Though trouble follows me like a plague, my ferocious and lighthearted nature allows me to shake it off. I've worked hard to make something of myself, and I've built a strong circle of good friends around me.

I'm a professional rogue, an expert at subtlety and intrigue. I blend into the crowd, and I'm good at finding people, places, and information that are not meant to be found. When you need a nimble expert of bow, pistol and whirling daggers, I'm the woman you should look for.

##Feairraelly Shaeln ("Elly")
_Norn Ranger_

My mother brought me up to respect Raven, whom I have taken as my spirit guide. My father was always tinkering with things, and as a child I would follow him around everywhere, watching him work. After my coming of age, when it came time for me to forge a path for myself, I decided to travel to Rata Sum and study with the asura. Six years later, I returned with my engineer training to find a vastly different land than the one I left. The borderlands were overrun with grawl, and the jotun had turned mean. I wanted to help, but found whenever there was a skirmish I would spend more time preparing my equipment than I would fighting.

I sought some clarity at the shrine of Raven. I remembered that Raven teaches us that there's a time for thought and a time for action. I realized that I was spending far too much time thinking than I was acting. Valuable as my engineer training is, engineering is slow, when what was needed was quick-acting people to take on the intruders. So I picked up my grandfather's horn and sword, and with a raven on my shoulder set off to combat the icy menace.

I'm a ranger. I roam freely across the wilds, and I have a way with animals. I made good friends with the shaman of Bear, and she gave me one of her cubs to raise as my companion. I remain quiet and reserved, yet I make friends wherever I go. My enemies think twice before fighting me, for I never stand alone.

##Akaria Rubeathin ("Kari")
_Human Necromancer_

I grew up among the nobility, and have never wanted for anything. The common people love me, and so does the queen. I value the honor of my family's name, but have always wanted to show the people that I am worth something without it. So I set myself on a course of study, to learn the best way to defeat the rising evil in the land.

I held an apprenticeship with the archmage of Queen Jenna's court, and under his tutelage I learned all there is to know about Earth Elementalism. But try as I might, I could not make the energy flow. Dejected, I sought the advice of my dear friend Neranna, who suggested I hold a vigil at the Fount of Kormir. So I did, and in the soft waters of the fountain I found the truth: the only way to combat the rising evil in the land is to make peace with death and use it itself as a weapon. Though my father frowned upon it, I sought out the Necromancers' Enclave in the Underbelly of Lion's Arch, and I have been studying with them ever since.

When I go forth to face the evil in the land, I paint my face with the symbol of a skull, to signify to the people that I am at peace with death. I carry a knife (the symbol of blood), a string of nooses (a symbol of judgement), and a staff (the symbol of a leader). I am death's messenger, cleansing the land of evil and making it safe for my dear people.

##Vakanya Dolshynya ("Anya")
_Norn Warrior_

I never knew my parents. They were murdered by servants of Jormag, and I was raised by the shamans of the Wolf. Our precious homeland is lost to us, and we are still threatened by enemies on all sides. Sometimes my sorrow and rage threaten to consume me, but the spirit of Wolf has taught me that there is both a time for violence and a time for peace.

I have chosen the path of the warrior, and I work hard to maintain my physical strength and prowess. I carry an axe and a horn, the ancient weapons of my people, and I carry a hammer to break my foes, just as they have broken my heart. I wear no helm on the battlefield, as I would rather look my foes in the eyes. That way they may see my fearless determination and quake in the face of my righteous anger. I have dedicated my life to winning back our homeland, and until I can sit at my family's hearth and set my parents' souls to rest, I will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand against me.

##Yori Lawr ("Yori")
_Norn Mesmer_

Though trouble may follow me, I overcome it with charm. Snow Leopard, my spirit guide, teaches that there's a time to be serious and a time to laugh.

I listen to my intuition and instinct in dangerous situations. And yet, in the past, I've been careless. I overindulged in merriment at a moot and woke up the next morning with no memory of what I'd done. It's a mystery I must solve.

To the world, I'm never without my harlequin's smile.
