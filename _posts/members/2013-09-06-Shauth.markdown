**I'm Daeron Falconer, a Human Warrior.**

Balthazar, the god of war, blessed me when I was young. Though trouble may follow me, I overcome it with dignity.

I grew up among the nobility, and I value my honour. I've made something of myself, and the only thing I regret is that I never recovered my sister's body.

I'm a warrior, and I wear no helm on the battlefield. Because of this, my enemies falter when they see the fearless determination in my eyes.

**I am Brand Formion, a Norn Ranger.**

Though trouble may follow me, I overcome it with ferocity. Snow Leopard, my spirit guide, teaches that there's a time to be serious, and a time to laugh.

I listen to my intuition and instinct in dangerous situations. And yet, in the past, I have been foolish. I wagered Romke's Horn, an ancestral heirloom with magical properties, on a test of strength. I was overconfident, but I'm determined to get it back.

I'm a ranger, and I have a wolf that fights at my side and guards my back.
