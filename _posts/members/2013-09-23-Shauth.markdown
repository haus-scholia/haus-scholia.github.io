**## I'm Daeron Falconer, a level 40 Human Warrior.**

Balthazar, the god of war, blessed me when I was young. Though trouble may follow me, I overcome it with dignity.

I grew up among the nobility, and I value my honour. I've made something of myself, and the only thing I regret is that I never recovered my sister's body.

I'm a warrior, and I wear no helm on the battlefield. Because of this, my enemies falter when they see the fearless determination in my eyes.

**## I am Brand Formion, a level 12 Norn Ranger.**

Though trouble may follow me, I overcome it with ferocity. Snow Leopard, my spirit guide, teaches that there's a time to be serious, and a time to laugh.

I listen to my intuition and instinct in dangerous situations. And yet, in the past, I have been foolish. I wagered Romke's Horn, an ancestral heirloom with magical properties, on a test of strength. I was overconfident, but I'm determined to get it back.

I'm a ranger, and I have a wolf that fights at my side and guards my back.

**## I be Ithronaur, a level 7 Asura Fire Elementalist.**

Though trouble may follow me, I overcome it with charm. I be a member in good standing of the College of Dynamics.

My first invention was a transatmospheric converter, and one day, my adoring fans will say that I have surpassed even my first advisor, Master Bronk.

I be an elementalist, and I study all the elements. I wear a gem that symbolizes my love of fire.
