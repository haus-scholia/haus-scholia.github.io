##Zendella
_Human Mesmer_

I was born to a family of nobles in Divinity's Reach. We've always been wealthy, and my mother says our bloodline can be traced back to ancient Kyrtan kings. I don't care much for riches, although I admit, growing up priveleged in the upper class of Divinity's Reach definitely had its perks. Having free access to the finest spirits and company that Kryta can offer is boatloads of fun. But I couldn't help always yearning for more.. I always desired adventure.

I remember when I was a kid, I had a twin sister.  Her name was Orianna. On my 11th birthday she was kidnapped.. taken by bandits. Since that day, I've regretted not looking for her.

When I was born, the goddess Lyssa blessed me. That explains a lot, for example why I have a knack for conjuring illusions. Tt's a skill I've had since I can remember. Even when I was a kid, I could make people see things that weren't really there. It was incredibly fun using that trick to confuse people. I also had a way with words, which is something I found out from an early age. Yeah, I definitely have a talent for charming myself out of (or into) just about anything. It was these same abilities that would later prompt me to grow into the experienced Mesmer I am today.

After years of training, I finally became skilled enough to use these abilities to find my sister. One fateful day in Shaemoor gave me access to the resources that would help me accomplish just that, and while it's been a great ride, I can't help but feel this yearning to achieve even more. Maybe it's not even so much about the fame, or fortune, or glory... although that all sounds great to me. But really I think it's all about something more. I think I just want to bring chaos and confusion to all the enemies of Tyria. Bad guys annoy me, and I have the power to make them think twice about what's real and what isn't. And if you ask me? Nothing's more hilarious than watching a Risen dance around under the illusion that he's a pretty ballerina!

Haha... my superiors don't always approve of my methods. But hey, that's their problem. They just haven't got the joke yet!

##Karistany
_Human Guardian_

Although I grew up in the nobility of Divinity's Reach, I never knew my birth parents. My adoptive parents were good to me; they raised me to be respectful and honest. I was always told Dwayna had blessed me, which makes sense, considering I have a gift for healing. I've always been a devoutly spiritual person.

When I became of age, I decided to join the Temple of Fanatics and become a Guardian. I took to the art right away, and my superiors were impressed with my natural attunement to the light as well as my healing ability. Although many of the monks and priests of my order can be a bit harsh, I tend to have a more open view on the world. I tackle life head-on and prefer to use my sense of Honor and Dignity in all my personal affairs.

Eventually I was reunited with my sister Kimiko, who was raised by our birth-parents in the sunny plains of Queensdale. Getting the chance to meet my mother and father was an honor and a privelege.

With my trusty shield and Dwayna by my side, it is my job to protect the innocent and to serve the Greater Good.

##Selia Jade
_Sylvari Necromancer_

My name is Selia. I awoke under the Pale Tree during the Cycle of Dusk. I can feel the dusk's essence within me; magic and mystery courses through my veins. The most important of Ventari's teachings is in my opinion "Act with wisdom, but act".

While in my slumber, I dreamt of the moon. It was from this moment that I knew the mystic realm had called to me. I would be born with the gift of magic.

Of what brand of magic, I was not yet sure. When I awoke, I found that I could speak to the dead - I had been born a Necromancer.

I took this duty willfully, and I will continue to grow until I can harness the power of death for all the good of Tyria. Whatever problems may come my way, I will face them determinedly and aggressively. My fierocity cannot be extinguished.

Somebody has to protect the land, and as a Sylvari, it is my job to do so. And even though death may come knocking on our doorstep at the worst of times, I will fearlessly stare death in the face with the mask of a skull, and remind him that he works for me, for Tyria, for all living things. The sanctity of life must be protected against the dragons, no matter the cost.
