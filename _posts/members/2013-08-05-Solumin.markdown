## Ash Clawburn
Charr Engineer -- Focus: Flamethrower, Pistols/Shield
_Master Huntsman, Master Leatherworker_

Like other charr, I never knew my parents; I was raised in the Iron Legion fahrar. That is where I learned and grew. I met my warband--my real family--in the fahrar and were inseperable until they were killed in an Ascalonian attack on the Black Citadel. Only Clawspur, my sparring partner, survived. I am now forming my own warband from the charr that Clawspur and I meet in our travels.

Though I never really knew my father, I know he is a loyal soldier in the Legion. I will live up to his reputation and keep the honor of the Iron Legion and my warband.

I'm an engineer in the proud tradition of my Legion. I wear my eagle-eye goggles, my first creation, with pride. As an engineer, I rely upon kits and turrets in battle. I'm especially fond of my flamethrower and find few enemies that can stand against it. I also use turrets as backup, though they tend to break as soon as an enemy looks at them. When all else fails, I fall back on my trusty pistol and a shield. In battle, I let others charge forward while I support them with healing and fire from behind. But I know the value of a good offence, and I try to plan accordingly.

Outside of battle, I rely on my dignity to carry me through any trouble I face.

## Eoghan the Limber
Sylvari Thief -- Focus: Pistols/Daggers, Shortbow, Poisons

The Pale Tree woke me from the Dream during the Cycle of Dawn. Accordingly, I'm friendly and sociable, and I use my wit and charm to my advantage. If I wasn't such a good thief, I'd make an excellent diplomat! I'm something of a free spirit and let the winds guide me. To me, Ventari's most important lesson is, "Where life goes, so too, should you."

I was awakened to help defend the Pale Tree and the Sylvari. While Dreaming I saw the Green Knight. It is my duty to find and vanquish him in order to protect my people.

As a thief, my strengths lie in subtletly and disguises. I blend into a crowd to track my targets. I strike when I have a chance, relying on my strong daggers to take down the foe. Sometimes I'll add a dash poison to seal the deal. If the battle needs to be quiet and at a distance, I use my shortbow to great effect. And when all else fails, I fall back on my dual pistols to carry me through the worst trouble.
