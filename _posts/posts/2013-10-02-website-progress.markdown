Here's what has been accomplished:

1. Basic site skeleton.
2. A charter with all the important guild information.
3. A serialized roster system.
4. A serialized blog system.

Here's what remains to be done:

1. A serialized gallery system.
2. Open access for members to post content.
3. Style the site.
