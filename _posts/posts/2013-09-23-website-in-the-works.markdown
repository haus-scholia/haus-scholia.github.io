I'm working on a site for the guild.

1. I think it would be nice to have a public face on the world.
2. I really like making websites.

It's super basic to start, but I'll be working on making it easy for everybody to post on the blog, and add to the gallery and roster.

Feedback is welcome on the discussion groups (Steam or Facebook).
